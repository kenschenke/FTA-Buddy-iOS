<h1>Welcome to FTA Buddy</h1>

<p>
    This app is for volunteers at FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) events in the FTA (FIRST Technical Adviser) or
    FTAA (FIRST Technical Adviser Assistant) roles.  It's a small app that serves three main purposes: display the
    field monitor in an embedded browser, show flashcards (like the FTA Notepad app), and show a quick reference
    page with some helpful technical tidbits.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: this app was developed entirely by me with no input or cooperation with FIRST.  FIRST had
    nothing do with this app, so no endorsement or implicit approval is implied.  If you want to know more information
    about FIRST, visit their web site at <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org">www.firstinspires.org</a>.

<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>
    This app collects no information about you.  Privacy policies tend to have a few important sections, so I'll put
    them in here for completeness.
</p>

<p><strong>What Information We Collect</strong></p>

<p>Nothing.  No information is collected.</p>

<p><strong>How We Use Information We Collect and Receive</strong></p>

<p>We don't.  No information is collected.</p>

<p><strong>Information Sharing</strong></p>

<p>There is no sharing since no information is collected.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies and Tracking</strong></p>

<p>
    FTA Buddy does not use any cookies.  Web sites you visit with the embedded browser might, but that's not
    FTA Buddy doing that.  The app doesn't track user behavior at all.  No analytics are collected and the app doesn't
    "phone home".
